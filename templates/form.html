    <h1>Student Mental Wellness Survey</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Student Mental Health Prediction AI project! Weâ€™re working on creating an AI model to predict
        mental health issues among students. Your participation in this survey will greatly assist us in developing a
        tool that can identify signs of depression and anxiety early on. Rest assured, all information you provide will
        be kept strictly confidential. Your responses will help us understand the challenges students face and improve
        mental health support services. Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this important endeavor!</p>
